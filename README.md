Anomaly Detection in Healthcare: Detecting Patient Health Deterioration


Scenario



Wearable devices like smartwatches, fitness trackers, and medical-grade monitoring devices are increasingly used to track vital signs such as:

	•	Heart rate

	•	Blood oxygen levels (SpO2)

	•	Body temperature

	•	Respiration rate

	•	Sleep patterns

	•	Physical activity



Anomaly detection can analyze this continuous stream of data to identify early signs of potential health issues, such as:

	•	Cardiac arrhythmia or irregular heartbeats.

	•	Respiratory distress (e.g., from asthma or COPD exacerbation).

	•	Sudden drops in oxygen levels, indicating hypoxia or sleep apnea.

	•	Sudden inactivity or a fall, indicating accidents.



Why It’s Important

	1.	Preventive Care: Early detection of anomalies can allow healthcare providers to intervene before the condition worsens.

	2.	Remote Monitoring: Patients can be monitored at home, reducing hospital visits and healthcare costs.

	3.	Personalized Medicine: Devices can create a baseline for each patient’s “normal” health metrics, improving anomaly detection accuracy.



How It Works

	1.	Baseline Creation: Collect data over time to establish what is “normal” for the individual.

	2.	Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously analyze incoming data from wearables.

	3.	Anomaly Detection: Use machine learning algorithms to flag deviations from the baseline.

	4.	Alerts: Notify the patient or healthcare provider if a critical anomaly is detected.
