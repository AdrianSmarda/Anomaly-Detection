# Anomaly Detection Program

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques for **anomaly detection** in physiological data. The goal is to identify anomalies that may indicate potential health issues. The project utilizes **Isolation Forest** for unsupervised anomaly detection and **Random Forest** for supervised classification.

## Purpose

The main objective of this program is to analyze physiological data, such as heart rate, body temperature, and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), to detect anomalies and classify health statuses as "Infected" or "Non-Infected." The program provides insights into using machine learning models for anomaly detection in health monitoring.

## Features

- Supports preprocessing of physiological data with standardization and outlier filtering.
- Implements **Isolation Forest** for detecting anomalies in an unsupervised manner.
- Includes **Random Forest Classifier** for supervised classification of health statuses.
- Provides both 2D and 3D visualizations of model predictions and classification results.
